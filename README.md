Project: Multi-Dimensional Network Traffic Classification üåêüìä
This repository hosts the implementation of a Deep Learning-based framework for multi-dimensional network traffic classification, designed to identify benign vs. malicious traffic, specific attack types, and various application types. The project integrates three pre-trained deep learning models within a Flask web application, allowing users to upload new network traffic datasets for real-time classification and analysis.

Methodology: Step-by-Step Project Usage
The core functionality of this project revolves around a sophisticated classification pipeline that processes user-uploaded network traffic data. Below is a detailed breakdown of the methodology employed when a user interacts with the web application:

Dataset Upload: ‚¨ÜÔ∏èüìÇ

Users initiate the process by uploading a raw network traffic dataset (e.g., a CSV file) to the Flask web application. This dataset contains flow-based features similar to those used during model training.

Automated Preprocessing: ‚öôÔ∏è‚ú®

Upon upload, the system applies the identical, rigorous preprocessing pipeline that was used to train the deep learning models. This includes:

Removal of any missing or infinite values.

Robust normalization of numerical features (using the Robust Scaler) to handle outliers and scale data consistently.

Encoding of categorical labels to a numerical format compatible with the models.

Where applicable, data augmentation techniques are applied to ensure robust and balanced data representation, mirroring the training environment.

Initial Binary Classification (Normal vs. Malicious): üö¶

The preprocessed dataset is first fed into the Binary Classification CNN model. This model's primary task is to categorize each network flow as either Normal ‚úÖ (benign) or Abnormal üö® (malicious). This serves as the critical first layer of defense and categorization.

Conditional Multi-Class Classification: üîÑ

Based on the output of the binary classification, the system intelligently routes the traffic for further, more granular analysis:

If a flow is classified as Normal ‚úÖ: It is then passed to the Application Type Classification LSTM model üì±. This model specializes in identifying the specific application responsible for the traffic (e.g., HTTP, YouTube, Spotify, etc.), providing insights into network usage and legitimate activity.

If a flow is classified as Abnormal üö®: It is then directed to the Attack Type Classification CNN model üõ°Ô∏è. This model is trained to pinpoint the exact category of attack (e.g., DoS Hulk, PortScan, DDoS, XSS), enabling precise threat identification and response.

Results and Analysis: üìàüîç

The final classification results (binary, attack type, or application type) are presented to the user. This output provides actionable insights into the nature of the network traffic, supporting network management, security monitoring, and resource optimization efforts.

This step-by-step process ensures that the models are utilized effectively based on the initial assessment of network traffic, providing a comprehensive and conditional classification capability through a user-friendly web interface.
