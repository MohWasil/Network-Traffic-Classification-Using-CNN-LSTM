# Network-Traffic-Classification-Using-CNN-LSTM
This project is multi class classification of network traffic. It can help organization's network admin to monitor their traffic.
The propose is a multi-model deep learning approach to classify network traffic with high accuracy across multiple categories, addressing binary classification, attack type classification, and application type identification using CNN and LSTM algorithms. To begin, the raw dataset was preprocessed, including handling missing values, encoding categorical features, and removing features that could introduce noise or bias. The 75 apps dataset was filtered to eliminate labels with fewer than 1,000 instances, preventing class imbalance and model bias. The resulting dataset was then balanced through oversampling, ensuring adequate representation across classes. For the binary classification task, CNN is used to distinguish between normal and abnormal traffic, achieving efficient and accurate results of 99.74. A second CNN was designed to classify different types of attacks, further enhancing security insights with accuracy of 96.7. Finally, an LSTM model was employed for application type classification, leveraging its strength in capturing sequential dependencies in traffic patterns with accuracy of 99.01. These models were evaluated individually using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and confusion matrix, providing a comprehensive assessment of each modelâ€™s performance.
